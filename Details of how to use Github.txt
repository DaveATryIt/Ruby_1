To get to this….
Created account on Github
Created blank New Repository called Ruby_1
With one file README.md

On Mac Terminal checked that Git was installed
Installed GIT Desktop (Git GUI)

Went into Github under my new account
Selected the Ruby_1 Repository - and then selected Clone or download
Then selected to open it in Desktop….selecting David as the location
Then closed Desktop….
Closed Github

Looked at /usr/David/ lo and behold the directory and contents were there.


Added this file to the directory and will attempt to synchronise with the Github remote…
===================================================================
Synchronisation was done by using FILE Upload - choosing it from my hard drive

Then the change was COMMITTED which moved the file from my local drive into this public repository

The I went in within Github and added these three lines of text and committed the changes
